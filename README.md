20Factor is a simple card game built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript

Here is the presentation of the game on Heroku:

HELPFUL GUIDES:

This is a game with two sets of cards. The first set comprises of one big card with a randomly generated number on it -- between 0 and 2000. The second set consists of nine cards numbered 1 to 9. For each round of the game, you will click on each of the 9-card set IF it is a factor of whatever number is generated in the 1-card set.

For example, if the 1-card set generates 2, you will be expected to click on 1 and 2 to get full marks (which would be shown in a confirm box at the end of the round). You will have 20 seconds to click on all the right cards to get a full mark -- 100%. There is  a small timer in the lower section of the page to monitor how long it is taking you.

If you clicked on the wrong number, however -- for example, if you clicked on 3 in the above example -- your marks would be deducted as you do so along with an ugly buzzer. But if you get it right, you will hear a bell and a splash and your card would disappear.

NOTE: All the functionalities work seamlessly in Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge browsers. In Chrome and Safari, however, there are a few bugs. So I continue to track them down and fix them.
